# Book Connect ASP.NET MVC Web App

## Description

Adaptation of (https://github.com/katlegomaphango/KATMAP076_FTO2301_GroupB_KatlegoMaphango_ITW19)[Book Connect] Web App.
The Book Connect web application has a list of books available so that users can discover new books to read. A user can click on a book to view the summary of the book and also shows the date each book was published so that the user can determine how easy it is to get a second-hand copy of the book. The user does not have to remember the whole title of a book or full name of the author, they can just search using just part of the book title or author name to get desired results. The user can also filter the book list according to title, author and/or genre of the book, also for user comfort they toggle between day and night mode.
